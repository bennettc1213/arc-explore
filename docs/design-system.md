Design system — "ben*" / Arc Automations
A reference doc for reusing this site's look, feel, and interaction patterns on another project. Written from the actual source in src/, not from memory — every value here is copy-pasteable.

The one-line summary: dark, high-contrast, one aggressive accent color, lowercase everything, oversized type, and a cast of small "earned" motion details instead of decoration. Nothing fades in just to fade in.

1. Design philosophy (read this before copying anything)
One accent, no exceptions. A single saturated color carries every highlight, CTA, glow, cursor, and focus state. Never a second accent hue.
Lowercase as a signature. All body copy, headings, nav labels, and buttons are lowercase. It reads as deliberate, not lazy — pair it with large type so it doesn't read as low-effort.
Every animation earns its place. No fade-in-on-scroll for its own sake. Motion either communicates state (a counter ticking, a line drawing in to show progress) or personality (the mascot). If you'd cut it and nothing would be lost, cut it.
Snap, don't always tween. Some things (a mascot, a counter, a tab switch) change state in a single frame — no easing. This reads as "mechanical" / "pixel-art" and contrasts nicely with the smooth GSAP scroll elsewhere. Mixing snapped and eased motion is a deliberate choice, not an inconsistency.
Honesty over placeholder mockups. Missing content renders as an explicitly-labeled dashed slot (see §7), never a stock photo or fake data. If you don't have the real number, don't show a number.
Respect prefers-reduced-motion completely. Every effect below has a reduced-motion fallback that keeps the content fully usable — it just loses the animation. This is not optional polish; it's load-bearing.
2. Color tokens
:root {
  /* surfaces — a near-black stack, not pure #000 */
  --bg: #0a0a0b;
  --bg-2: #0f0f11;
  --surface: #141416;
  --surface-2: #1a1a1d;

  /* hairlines — translucent white, never a flat gray hex */
  --line: rgba(237, 237, 239, 0.09);
  --line-strong: rgba(237, 237, 239, 0.18);

  /* text */
  --text: #ededef;   /* primary */
  --muted: #96969e;  /* body copy on dark */
  --faint: #5c5c64;  /* captions, disabled, secondary labels */

  /* the one accent — signal orange */
  --accent: #ff4d00;
  --accent-hot: #ff6b2b;   /* hover state */
  --accent-lite: #ffa366;  /* the "eye" pixel, soft highlights */
  --accent-dim: rgba(255, 77, 0, 0.13);   /* fills, badges */
  --accent-glow: rgba(255, 77, 0, 0.45);  /* box-shadow glows */

  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
  --ease-inout: cubic-bezier(0.76, 0, 0.24, 1);
}
Why this works: surfaces step up in ~5% lightness increments (#0a0a0b → #0f0f11 → #141416 → #1a1a1d), so cards read as "slightly raised" without a single box-shadow. Hairlines are alpha-white rather than a flat gray so they inherit whatever's behind them. The accent has exactly three strengths (solid / dim-fill / glow) — reuse those three everywhere instead of inventing new opacities per component.

To reuse on a new site: swap --accent for your own color and keep everything else. The system was built to make that a one-line change — grep for #ff4d00 / rgba(255, 77, 0 / --accent and you're done. Pick a saturated, high-contrast color; pastel accents don't survive this much near-black.

3. Typography
--font-sans: 'Space Grotesk Variable', 'Space Grotesk', system-ui, sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'IBM Plex Mono', ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Mono', monospace;
--font-garamond: 'EB Garamond', Georgia, serif; /* one project-specific echo, see §9 */
Display/body: Space Grotesk (variable weight) — geometric, slightly quirky, reads well oversized. Loaded via @fontsource-variable.
Everything technical: IBM Plex Mono — nav labels, eyebrows, stats labels, tech tags, code-adjacent UI, timestamps. This is what makes the site feel "engineered" rather than "designed."
Scale: headlines use clamp() so they're fluid, not breakpointed:
.section-title { font-size: clamp(2.2rem, 5.4vw, 4.4rem); font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: -0.03em; }
.hero__title   { font-size: clamp(3.1rem, 11.4vw, 9.8rem); font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: -0.045em; }
Tight negative letter-spacing (−0.03 to −0.045em) at large sizes is what keeps oversized type from looking loose.
The "eyebrow" label: every section opens with a small mono kicker — a short orange tick-mark, then NN — section name in muted mono. This is the single most repeated typographic pattern on the site:
.eyebrow { font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: .08em; color: var(--faint); display:flex; align-items:center; gap:12px; }
.eyebrow::before { content:''; width:28px; height:1px; background:var(--accent); }
4. Layout primitives
--nav-h: 72px;
--gutter: clamp(20px, 4vw, 64px); /* fluid page margin */

.wrap { padding-inline: var(--gutter); max-width: 1560px; margin-inline: auto; }
One wide max-width (1560px), one fluid gutter variable used everywhere instead of per-component padding. Sections default to position: relative so absolutely-positioned decoration (roamers, circuit lines, sweep animations) can be scoped without extra wrapper divs.

5. The mascot — "pixel guy"
The single most distinctive element on the site: a tiny pixel-art character built entirely from SVG <rect> elements on a 10×10 grid (no image files, no anti-aliasing — shape-rendering="crispEdges").

Construction: a handful of row-strings ('...xxxx...' etc.) define head/body/feet; x marks a filled pixel. One pixel is designated the "eye" and rendered in --accent-lite instead of --accent — that's the only two-tone moment he ever has. Facing (left/center/right) is done by shifting the head rows ±1 column and moving the eye column, not by transforming/flipping the SVG — this keeps every pose looking authored rather than mirrored.

const HEAD = ['...xxxx...', '..xxxxxx..', '..xxxxxx..', '..xxxxxx..', '..xxxxxx..', '...xxxx...'];
const BODY = ['..xxxxxx..', '.xxxxxxxx.', '.xxxxxxxx.'];
const FEET_A = '..xx..xx..';
const FEET_B = '.xx....xx.'; // alternate frame for walking
Golden rule: he never tweens. Every state change is a hard cut — transition is intentionally absent on his transform. This is what makes him read as a "character" instead of a "UI element." Contrast this with literally everything else on the site, which eases.

His behaviors, and where they live:

Behavior	Trigger	Notes
Idle blink	random 4–7s timer	randomized so it never feels metronomic — a fixed interval reads as robotic
Face the cursor	mousemove, 3 discrete zones	left / center / right based on cursor x vs. his bounding box center — snaps, never rotates smoothly
Squash	scroll delta > threshold	loses one pixel-row for ~150ms on a fast scroll, "springs" back by removing the class
Hop	click	a 7-frame keyframe sequence ([-2u,-3u,-3u,-2u,0,1,0]) — note the final 1 is a 1px overshoot past rest before settling, which is what sells the "landing"
Walk cycle	PixelWalker variant	alternates FEET_A/FEET_B on an interval while translating x — used in the footer ticker
Roam	PixelRoamer variant	a tiny state machine (walk / idle / hop) with randomized transition probabilities, paces a "floor line" behind hero content at low opacity
Physics body	dropped into matter-js	he's a real rigid body in the toolkit section — draggable, collides, rotates — while still blinking/tracking independently of the physics loop
Placements used: nav (small, next to wordmark), footer (large), footer ticker (walking, looping), hero background (roaming, ~0.45 opacity, z-index: -1 so text always wins), toolkit physics pit (as a throwable body), a static glyph swapped in for every 4th separator in the marquees, and a "confirmation" hop on a form-success state.

Reuse note: this pattern generalizes to any brand mark — swap the pixel map for your own mascot/logo shape and every behavior (blink, face- cursor, hop, walk, physics-drop) ports over unchanged, since none of it is specific to this particular character's shape.

6. Background — "the grid gets warm"
A fixed full-viewport <canvas> (z-index: -1, pointer-events: none) sits behind literally everything and renders two things, both extremely subtle (opacity budget: 0.05–0.12 total — if you can consciously see the background pattern, it's tuned too hot):

A dot grid, spaced ~28px (46px on mobile — density drops for performance and to avoid moiré on small screens), scroll-anchored so it feels attached to the page rather than the viewport.
Cursor-reactive brightening — dots within a 200px radius of the mouse brighten and grow (desktop + fine pointer only). Falloff is linear by distance.
A scroll-lagged "heat bloom" — a soft horizontal gradient band that eases toward the current scroll position (bloom += (scrollY - bloom) * 0.055 per frame) rather than snapping to it, so it visibly trails during fast scrolling — like a heat trail.
Performance pattern worth stealing: the render loop uses a dirty flag. It only calls draw() when the mouse moved, scroll changed, or the bloom hasn't caught up yet — and it stops requesting frames entirely once the bloom settles (Math.abs(bloom - scrollY) < 0.5). This is a canvas that costs ~0% CPU while idle instead of running a 60fps loop forever.

const loop = () => {
  if (Math.abs(bloom - scrollY) > 0.5) { bloom += (scrollY - bloom) * 0.055; dirty = true; }
  if (dirty) { draw(); dirty = false; }
  raf = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
};
Killed entirely (return null) under prefers-reduced-motion.

7. Custom cursor + trail
Replaces the native cursor (* { cursor: none !important }, gated to (pointer: fine) and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)) with:

A core: a small solid square (10px, 18px over interactive elements) that snaps size instantly — no transition. Never a circle, never a dot — squares reinforce the pixel-art motif.
A trail: 10 progressively smaller/fainter squares chasing the core via a real spring simulation (not CSS transitions):
vx[i] = (vx[i] + (target - px[i]) * k) * damping; // k≈0.22 idle, 0.42 near interactive
px[i] += vx[i];
Each square chases the one ahead of it, so fast movement visibly stretches the chain and stopping lets it "settle" with real inertia. The loop self-stops (running = false) once total velocity drops below a threshold — same idle-cost trick as the background canvas.
Trail sits at z-index: 1 — above the background canvas, below page content (z-index: 2) — so it reads as riding on the page.
Killed outright under reduced motion or on touch/coarse pointers.

8. Motion language — the rules that keep it coherent
Pattern	Used for	Implementation note
Mask-slide reveal	hero line-by-line entrance, word-cycling headline	overflow:hidden wrapper + inner transform: translateY — the classic "type rises out of its own baseline" reveal
Word-cycler	rotating last word in a headline	Framer Motion AnimatePresence mode="popLayout", y: '105%' → 0 → '-105%', ease: [0.76,0,0.24,1]. Must set position: relative on the wrapper — popLayout absolutely-positions the exiting element, and it'll escape an unpositioned mask.
Direction-aware marquee	capability-tag tickers	Not CSS @keyframes — a requestAnimationFrame loop tracking scroll delta: direction flips on scroll-up, speed gets a temporary "kick" proportional to scroll velocity that decays back to cruise (targetSpeed += (base - targetSpeed) * 0.045). Reduced motion: freezes into a static wrapped row.
Count-up stats	any stat block	GSAP + ScrollTrigger, once: true, tween a plain {v:0} object and write .textContent in onUpdate — cheaper than re-rendering React state every frame.
Sticky-stacked panels	project/portfolio showcase	Each panel position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100svh, then GSAP scrubs the previous panel's scale/opacity down as the next one arrives — this is what sells "cards stacking," not z-index tricks. Falls back to plain stacked cards under 900px via gsap.matchMedia().
Circuit-line draw-in	connecting an index number to its visual	An SVG <path> with pathLength="1", animate stroke-dashoffset 1→0 scrubbed to scroll position — classic "line draws itself in," but tied to pin progress instead of a fixed duration.
Mechanical tick counter	index numbers, tab counters	Not eased — literally increments the integer on an interval (cur += Math.sign(target - cur)) so it visually "counts" rather than crossfading. Reads as machinery, pairs well with the mono font.
Type-in label	URL labels appearing on hover	setInterval revealing one more character of a string, with a blinking <i> caret block. Same "mechanical, not smooth" family as the tick counter.
1px press offset	every hover state on buttons/links	translate: 1px 1px on :hover, no transition. Reads as "physically pressed," costs nothing, and is the opposite motion-language from the smooth GSAP entrances — the contrast is the point.
Pixel-corner focus ring	keyboard focus, replacing outline	Four small <i> corner-brackets positioned via getBoundingClientRect() on focusin, styled as border L-shapes instead of a rounded outline. Ties focus states into the pixel-art language instead of looking like a browser default.
9. Content-card patterns
Honest media slots (.slot): any spot expecting a real screenshot/video that hasn't been supplied yet renders a dashed-border box with a diagonal hatch background, the exact expected filename in mono, and a spec line (e.g. "1920×1080, hero frame"). Never a gray placeholder or lorem-picsum stock image. This means the site is deploy-safe before every asset exists — nothing looks broken, it looks intentionally unfinished.
Hover-reveal rows: a collapsed list row expands via grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr on hover (no JS height calc needed) to reveal a full preview + a live-URL label. Falls back to tap-to-expand on touch.
Click-to-view-live pattern: when a project has a real URL, the entire visual becomes one <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> — not just a small "view" button — with a low-opacity accent-color wash on hover and the URL label brightening + an arrow sliding in. Projects without a real URL stay inert; never fake a link.
One brand echo, used sparingly: one card in the showcase (a coffee brand called Rue Noir) borrows that brand's actual palette/typeface inside its own card (--rn-paper, --rn-ink, EB Garamond) as a live "echo" rather than a screenshot. This is a nice trick if you're showcasing other branded work: prove you can hold someone else's design language for a few square inches without it clashing with the parent site.
10. Full-screen overlay pattern (conversion flow)
A takeover panel (not a modal card) for anything conversion-critical (here: a lead-intake + booking flow):

position: fixed; inset: 0, same dot-grid background as the rest of the site (visual continuity — an overlay should never look like a different product), pixel-corner focus rings carry through.
Body scroll locks via the smooth-scroll library's own .stop() method (not just overflow: hidden on body — if you're running Lenis/ Locomotive, lock that, or wheel events leak through).
One question per screen, big tap targets, square corners (no border-radius — rounded corners would break the pixel-art language here), filled-accent on selection, auto-advance on choice (no separate "next" click for single-select questions).
Nothing in this flow animates over ~200ms. This is a conversion path, not a showcase — the rule above ("every animation earns its place") gets stricter, not looser, once money/leads are on the line.
Always ships a non-JS-dependent fallback (here: mailto: with the answers pre-filled in the body) so a failed integration never dead-ends the user.
11. Tech stack (if porting the actual implementation, not just the look)
React 18 + Vite
GSAP 3 + ScrollTrigger    → scroll-scrubbed animation, count-ups, matchMedia breakpoints
Lenis                     → smooth-scroll (drives ScrollTrigger's update on its own rAF)
Framer Motion             → component-level transitions (word-cycler, accordion)
matter-js                 → physics (draggable toolkit chips + the mascot as a body)
@fontsource-variable      → self-hosted variable fonts, no Google Fonts network call
Lenis + ScrollTrigger wiring (the one non-obvious integration point):

const lenis = new Lenis({ duration: 1.1, easing: t => Math.min(1, 1.001 - 2**(-10*t)) });
lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update);
gsap.ticker.add((time) => lenis.raf(time * 1000));
gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0);
All decorative layers (WarmGrid, CursorSquare, PixelRoamer, the marquee requestAnimationFrame loop) are hand-rolled rAF loops rather than library-driven — kept dependency-free since they're each <150 lines and benefit from tight control over the idle/dirty-flag optimization.

12. Quick-start checklist for a new site in this style
Copy --bg/--bg-2/--surface/--surface-2, swap --accent for your color.
Load a geometric sans (variable weight) + a mono for all-caps/technical labels. Lowercase everything in copy.
Build the .eyebrow + .section-title primitives first — they're used on every section and set the visual rhythm immediately.
Pick one mascot/mark and give it 3–4 snapped (non-eased) behaviors before anything else — it does more for "personality" than every other effect combined.
Add the background canvas last, tuned to the point of being barely perceptible. If a first-time visitor mentions the background unprompted, turn it down further.
Audit every animation against the one rule: does cutting this lose information or personality? If no, cut it.
