Build prompt — orange grid background, mascot, and core UI
Paste everything below this line into a new Claude Code chat for the other project. It's written as a standalone brief — no context from this conversation is assumed. Scroll-driven effects (sticky panels, scroll-lagged heat bloom, marquee direction-reversal, scroll-triggered count-ups, circuit lines that draw in on pin) are intentionally left out — this brief only covers the background, the logo/mascot, and general UI/button styling.

Prompt starts here
Build four things for this site: an orange dot-grid background with cursor reactivity, a pixel-art mascot/logo mark with a few idle behaviors, a custom square cursor, and the general button/UI language (colors, type, focus states). Everything below is a full spec — implement it as-is, then adjust to fit the existing codebase's file structure.

0. Foundation — color tokens & type
Add these CSS custom properties to the global stylesheet (root/body level):

:root {
  --bg: #0a0a0b;
  --bg-2: #0f0f11;
  --surface: #141416;
  --surface-2: #1a1a1d;

  --line: rgba(237, 237, 239, 0.09);
  --line-strong: rgba(237, 237, 239, 0.18);

  --text: #ededef;
  --muted: #96969e;
  --faint: #5c5c64;

  /* the ONE accent color — swap this hex for the brand's actual color,
     keep everything else. never introduce a second accent hue. */
  --accent: #ff4d00;
  --accent-hot: #ff6b2b;   /* hover state */
  --accent-lite: #ffa366;  /* soft highlight, e.g. the mascot's eye */
  --accent-dim: rgba(255, 77, 0, 0.13);   /* fills, badges */
  --accent-glow: rgba(255, 77, 0, 0.45);  /* box-shadow glow */
}

body {
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  font-family: 'Space Grotesk', system-ui, sans-serif; /* or the project's chosen sans */
}
Use a monospace font (IBM Plex Mono or similar) for anything technical: nav labels, small kickers/eyebrows, timestamps, tags. That mono/sans split is what makes the UI read as "engineered" rather than "designed."

Lowercase all copy in buttons, nav, and labels — it's a deliberate stylistic signature, not an oversight.

1. Orange dot-grid background with cursor crosshair reactivity
A fixed full-viewport <canvas> that sits behind all page content and renders a faint grid of orange dots. Dots near the cursor brighten and grow — that's the "crosshair" effect: a soft radius of light that follows the mouse across the grid, like a targeting reticle made of dots instead of lines.

Requirements:

position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: -1; pointer-events: none; — always behind content, never intercepts clicks.
Dot spacing ~28px on desktop, wider (~46px) on mobile — density drops on small screens for performance and to avoid a busy/noisy look.
Base dot opacity is very low — 0.06 to 0.09 on the base grid. This background should be almost subliminal. If someone looks at the page and immediately comments on the background pattern, it's tuned too strong — turn it down further.
Cursor reactivity (desktop + fine-pointer only): any dot within a ~200px radius of the cursor brightens and scales up slightly, with linear falloff by distance — full brightness right at the cursor, fading to the base 0.06–0.09 opacity at the edge of the radius. This is the "crosshair."
Disable cursor reactivity on touch devices / coarse pointers — check (pointer: fine) in a media query or window.matchMedia.
Performance — this matters: don't run the render loop unconditionally every frame forever. Track a "dirty" flag and only redraw when the mouse actually moved, the window resized, or the grid needs to reflect a state change. An idle page with a static cursor should cost ~0% CPU from this canvas.
Kill the entire component under prefers-reduced-motion: reduce — return null / don't mount the canvas at all. A single static low-opacity dot pattern (as a CSS background-image: radial-gradient(...) tile) can stand in for reduced-motion users if you still want texture there.
Reference implementation (React + canvas 2D, adapt to the target stack):

function WarmGrid() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = ref.current;
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    const spacing = window.innerWidth < 768 ? 46 : 28;
    const R = 200; // cursor falloff radius in px
    const fine = window.matchMedia('(pointer: fine)').matches;

    let W, H, raf, dirty = true;
    const mouse = { x: -9999, y: -9999 };

    function resize() {
      const dpr = Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio || 1, 2);
      W = window.innerWidth; H = window.innerHeight;
      canvas.width = W * dpr; canvas.height = H * dpr;
      ctx.setTransform(dpr, 0, 0, dpr, 0, 0);
      dirty = true;
    }
    resize();
    window.addEventListener('resize', resize);

    function onMove(e) { mouse.x = e.clientX; mouse.y = e.clientY; dirty = true; }
    if (fine) window.addEventListener('mousemove', onMove, { passive: true });

    function draw() {
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);
      for (let y = spacing / 2; y < H; y += spacing) {
        for (let x = spacing / 2; x < W; x += spacing) {
          let a = 0.07, s = 2;
          if (fine) {
            const dx = x - mouse.x, dy = y - mouse.y;
            const d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy;
            if (d2 < R * R) {
              const t = 1 - Math.sqrt(d2) / R;
              a = 0.07 + t * 0.25;
              s = 2 + Math.round(t * 2);
            }
          }
          ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(255,77,0,${a})`;
          ctx.fillRect(x - s / 2, y - s / 2, s, s);
        }
      }
    }

    function loop() {
      if (dirty) { draw(); dirty = false; }
      raf = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
    }
    raf = requestAnimationFrame(loop);

    return () => {
      cancelAnimationFrame(raf);
      window.removeEventListener('resize', resize);
      if (fine) window.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMove);
    };
  }, []);

  if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches) return null;
  return <canvas ref={ref} style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0, zIndex: -1, pointerEvents: 'none' }} />;
}
Mount this once near the root of the app, before/behind all other content.

2. The logo / mascot mark — pixel-art character
A small, blocky pixel-art character built entirely from <rect> elements in an SVG on a 10×10 grid — no image files, hard edges, no anti-aliasing (shape-rendering="crispEdges"). This is the brand mark; it appears small in the nav next to the wordmark, and larger in the footer.

Grid definition (x = filled pixel, one designated pixel is the "eye" and rendered in --accent-lite instead of --accent — the only two-tone moment the character has):

const HEAD = ['...xxxx...', '..xxxxxx..', '..xxxxxx..', '..xxxxxx..', '..xxxxxx..', '...xxxx...'];
const BODY = ['..xxxxxx..', '.xxxxxxxx.', '.xxxxxxxx.'];
const FEET_A = '..xx..xx..';
const FEET_B = '.xx....xx.'; // alternate frame, used for walking
const EYE_ROW = 3;
const EYE_COL = { left: 2, center: 4, right: 7 };
Facing direction (left/center/right) is achieved by shifting the head rows ±1 column (not by flipping/mirroring the SVG) and moving the eye column to match — this keeps every pose looking hand-authored instead of mechanically mirrored:

function shiftRow(row, dx) {
  if (dx === 0) return row;
  return dx > 0 ? '.' + row.slice(0, 9) : row.slice(1) + '.';
}

function buildRects(facing, { feet = FEET_A } = {}) {
  const dx = facing === 'left' ? -1 : facing === 'right' ? 1 : 0;
  const head = HEAD.map(r => shiftRow(r, dx));
  const rows = [...head, ...BODY, feet];
  const rects = [];
  rows.forEach((row, y) => {
    for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
      if (row[x] !== 'x') continue;
      rects.push({ x, y, eye: y === EYE_ROW && x === EYE_COL[facing] });
    }
  });
  return rects;
}
Render as:

<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" width={size} height={size} shapeRendering="crispEdges">
  {rects.map(r => (
    <rect key={`${r.x}-${r.y}`} x={r.x} y={r.y} width="1" height="1"
          fill={r.eye ? 'var(--accent-lite)' : 'var(--accent)'} />
  ))}
</svg>
The golden rule: this character never tweens. No CSS transition on his transform, ever. Every state change (facing, blink, hop) is a hard instant cut. That snappy, non-eased quality is what makes him read as a "character" instead of "a UI element that happens to be shaped like a character." Everything else in the UI can ease smoothly — he specifically should not.

Non-scroll-tied behaviors to implement:

Behavior	Trigger	How
Idle blink	randomized timer, 4–7 seconds	On mount, setTimeout a random 4000–7000ms, swap in a blink state (drop the eye rect, or render it as background color) for ~130ms, then schedule the next blink. Randomize the interval each cycle — a fixed interval reads as robotic and mechanical in a bad way.
Face the cursor	mousemove, whole-window listener	Compare event.clientX to the character's own bounding-box center. If cursor is left of (center − half element width), face left; if right of (center + half width), face right; otherwise center. Snap between the three states — no rotation, no easing, just swap which facing value is passed to buildRects.
Hop	click on the character	A short keyframe sequence stepping through Y-offsets, e.g. [-2u, -3u, -3u, -2u, 0, 1, 0] (u = a small unit like size/10) at ~55ms per frame, applied via style.transform = translateY(...). Note the second-to-last frame is 1 — a 1px overshoot past the resting position before settling back to 0. That tiny overshoot is what sells "landing" instead of just "stopping." Guard against re-triggering mid-hop.
Walk cycle	continuous, on an interval, while a "walking" variant is mounted (e.g. in a footer strip)	Alternate FEET_A / FEET_B every ~90ms while translating the character's x position across its container, looping back to the start when it exits.
Optional but nice: a "roaming" variant that idles in a wide empty area of the layout (e.g. behind a hero headline, at low opacity like 0.4–0.5, sent behind the text with z-index: -1) — a tiny state machine that alternates between walking a few steps, pausing to blink, occasionally turning around, and occasionally hopping, each transition picked with a small random probability per tick. Not required, but it's the single highest-charm addition if there's an empty background area to fill.

Kill all of the above under prefers-reduced-motion: reduce — render the character in a single static center-facing pose with no listeners attached.

3. Custom cursor — small square, never a dot
Replace the native cursor (desktop + fine pointer + motion-ok only) with a small solid square:

@media (pointer: fine) and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  * { cursor: none !important; }
}

.cursor-square {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0; left: 0;
  width: 10px; height: 10px;
  background: var(--accent);
  border: 1px solid var(--bg);
  z-index: 9999;
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0; /* fade in on first mouse move, not visible at (0,0) on load */
  /* no transition — it SNAPS between sizes, does not tween */
}
In JS: track mousemove, position the square at the cursor (translate3d for GPU compositing), and grow it to ~18px whenever the cursor is over an interactive element (a, button, [role="button"], input, etc. — check via event.target.closest(selector)). The size change is instant, not animated. Set opacity: 1 only after the first real mouse-move event so it doesn't flash at the top-left corner on page load.

(Optional, more advanced — skip if the target project wants something simpler: a chase-trail of several smaller, fainter squares following the core with a spring/damping simulation rather than CSS transitions, for extra visual weight. Only worth it if the base cursor already feels good and there's appetite for the extra complexity.)

4. Buttons & general UI language
Corners: favor sharp or barely-rounded corners on interactive elements (buttons, tags, cards) — 0 to 4px radius. Full pill shapes (border-radius: 999px) are reserved for pill/badge-style CTAs, not general UI. Avoid the generic "rounded SaaS card" look (12–20px radii everywhere).
Primary button: solid --accent fill, dark text (var(--bg) or near-black), medium font weight, mono or sans depending on context. Hover state: swap fill to --accent-hot, no other transition.
Ghost/secondary button: 1px solid var(--line-strong) border, transparent fill, --muted text. Hover: border and text brighten to --accent or --text.
The 1px press offset — apply this to every clickable element's hover state:
.btn:hover, a:hover, .nav-link:hover {
  translate: 1px 1px;
  /* no transition — instant, reads as a physical press */
}
This is a small but important detail: it's the opposite motion language from anything eased elsewhere on the page (word reveals, panel transitions), and that contrast is intentional — it makes buttons feel physically pressable rather than just "hovering."
Focus states — replace the default outline with pixel-corner brackets instead of a rounded outline:
:focus-visible { outline: none; }

.focus-ring { position: absolute; pointer-events: none; z-index: 9990; }
.focus-ring i { position: absolute; width: 8px; height: 8px; border: 2px solid var(--accent); }
.focus-ring i:nth-child(1) { top: 0; left: 0; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; }
.focus-ring i:nth-child(2) { top: 0; right: 0; border-left: none; border-bottom: none; }
.focus-ring i:nth-child(3) { bottom: 0; left: 0; border-right: none; border-top: none; }
.focus-ring i:nth-child(4) { bottom: 0; right: 0; border-left: none; border-top: none; }
On focusin, measure the focused element with getBoundingClientRect(), position one .focus-ring wrapper (containing those four corner <i> elements) around it with a small ~5px outset, and remove it on focusout. Four L-shaped corner brackets instead of a full rectangle outline — ties keyboard focus into the same pixel-art language as the mascot.
Selection color:
::selection { background: var(--accent); color: var(--bg); }
Scrollbar (WebKit + Firefox):
html { scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-color: var(--accent) var(--bg); }
::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 6px; height: 6px; background: var(--bg); }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background: var(--accent); }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover { background: var(--accent-hot); }
Small mono "eyebrow" label — the recurring pattern above section headings or nav groupings: a short horizontal tick mark in --accent, then a small mono label in --faint:
.eyebrow { font-family: monospace; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: .08em; color: var(--faint); display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; }
.eyebrow::before { content: ''; width: 28px; height: 1px; background: var(--accent); }
What NOT to include from this brief
Do not build scroll-triggered or scroll-scrubbed behavior as part of this task — no sticky/pinned panels, no scroll-position-driven background effects, no elements that reveal or animate specifically because the user scrolled to them, no scroll-direction-aware marquees. If the target project wants those later, that's a separate, follow-up brief. This pass is background + logo + mascot + cursor + buttons only.
